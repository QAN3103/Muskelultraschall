## Short Overview
This project contains the necessary code to train an artificial neuronal network (ANN), a support vector machine model (SVM) and a logistic regression model to...

## Road Map
The code consists of six main steps

### 1) Split data into train and test set
### 2) Data segmentation
### 3) Initiate the ANN/SVM/Logistic Regression model
### 4) Train the model
### 5) Make prediction using the trained models
### 6) Post-processing if needed

## Results
The results after training the ANN, SVM and logistic regression model are shown below



## Resources and Acknowledgemens
The data for training is provided by...
